# Foil Activation Flux Analyzer

This is a python API meant for simplyfing the analysis of foil activations in subcritical reactors, and sigma piles. 

## Mathematical Basis

This was created as Part of Micah Gale's thesis. For the derivation of the equations used please refer to chapter 3: Background of that thesis.
